# BART Alert Management System
## Business Overview & User Guide

---

## Executive Summary

The BART (Batch Alert Review Tool) Alert Management System is a comprehensive fraud detection and monitoring platform that helps our organization identify and respond to potential financial crimes. This system automatically creates and manages alerts based on various risk categories, enabling our team to efficiently review and take action on suspicious activities.

---

## What Problem Does BART Solve?

**Challenge:** Financial institutions must monitor thousands of transactions and entities daily to identify potential fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. Manually tracking all suspicious activities is impossible and time-consuming.

**Solution:** BART automates the alert creation process by:
- Monitoring high-risk entities and categories in real-time
- Creating alerts automatically when suspicious patterns are detected
- Providing a centralized dashboard for reviewing and managing alerts
- Ensuring no suspicious activity goes unnoticed

---

## How BART Works: A Step-by-Step Journey

### **Step 1: User Access**
üîê **What Happens:** A team member logs into the BART User Interface (UI)

**Business Value:** Secure, role-based access ensures only authorized personnel can view sensitive alert information.

---

### **Step 2: Manual Alert Creation**
üì§ **What Happens:** Users can upload custom categories or individual entities from the hotlist queue

**Who Does This:** Fraud analysts, compliance officers, or risk management team members

**Example Scenario:** 
- A compliance officer receives intelligence about a new fraud ring
- They upload the associated entity names into BART
- The system immediately begins monitoring these entities

**Categories Supported:**
1. **External FI** - Suspicious activities reported by other financial institutions
2. **NCFTA External** - Threats identified by the National Cyber-Forensics & Training Alliance
3. **Early Warning** - Preventive alerts for potential risks before they escalate
4. **Law Enforcement** - Entities flagged by law enforcement agencies
5. **Internal High Risk** - Customers identified internally as high-risk
6. **High Risk Open Account** - Newly opened accounts showing suspicious patterns

---

### **Step 3: System Processing**
‚öôÔ∏è **What Happens:** The BART UI communicates with backend services hosted on Azure AKS (cloud infrastructure)

**Technical Component:** Service Layer (API)

**Business Translation:** Think of this as the "brain" of BART. When you submit a request, this layer:
- Validates your input
- Securely communicates with the database
- Ensures data integrity
- Returns results quickly

**Why Azure AKS?**
- **Scalability:** Can handle thousands of requests simultaneously
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime ensures system availability
- **Security:** Enterprise-grade security protecting sensitive financial data

---

### **Step 4: Alert Generation**
üéØ **What Happens:** The system queries TigerGraph (our advanced database) to create alerts

**TigerGraph Database:** A powerful graph database that connects entities, transactions, and patterns

**What It Does:**
- Analyzes relationships between entities (e.g., shared addresses, linked accounts)
- Identifies suspicious patterns across millions of data points
- Creates alerts when risk thresholds are exceeded
- Prevents duplicate alerts for the same issue

**Example:** 
If John Doe is uploaded as "Internal High Risk," TigerGraph will:
- Check all his accounts and transactions
- Identify connected entities (family members, business partners)
- Generate an alert if suspicious activity is found
- Avoid creating duplicate alerts if one already exists

---

### **Step 5: Automated Daily Monitoring**
ü§ñ **What Happens:** Every day, automated scripts run in Azure AKS to check for new alerts

**Why Automation Matters:**
- **Consistency:** Never misses a day, even on weekends and holidays
- **Efficiency:** Processes thousands of records in minutes
- **Accuracy:** Eliminates human error in routine checks

**Daily Process:**
1. Script wakes up at scheduled time (e.g., 2:00 AM)
2. Pulls all entities with "Pending" status from hotlist
3. Checks TigerGraph for each entity
4. Creates new alerts if:
   - Entity has suspicious activity
   - No active alert already exists for this entity
5. Generates summary report for review

**Business Value:** Your team arrives each morning with fresh, accurate alerts ready for review‚Äîno manual data pulling required.

---

### **Step 6: Alert Review & Action**
üëÅÔ∏è **What Happens:** Users access the Alert Menu in BART UI to review and manage alerts

**User Actions Available:**
- **View All Alerts:** See complete list of pending, in-review, and closed alerts
- **Review Details:** Click on any alert to see full context (entity info, risk score, related transactions)
- **Update Status:**
  - **In Review:** Mark alert when investigation begins
  - **Closed:** Mark as closed when investigation completes (with resolution notes)

**Workflow Example:**
1. Analyst logs in Monday morning
2. Sees 15 new alerts from weekend processing
3. Opens first alert: "John Doe - Internal High Risk"
4. Reviews transaction history and risk indicators
5. Marks as "In Review" while investigating
6. After investigation, determines it's false positive
7. Closes alert with notes: "Verified legitimate business activity"
